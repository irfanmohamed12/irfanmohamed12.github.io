      As an faculty member in AI and Sensing technologies at the 
      <a href="https://www.utwente.nl/en/et/be/research/neuro-mech-eng-group/members/"  target="_blank">Neuromuscular Robotics</a>, I will be
      exploring research topics including      
      <ul>
        <li>modelling human-exosuit interfaces</li>
        <li>sparse wearable sensing modalities</li>
        <li>fusing model-free and model-based approaches for biomechanical modelling</li>
        <li>assistive robotics for occupational tasks</li>
        <li>assistive robotics for space exploration</li>

      During my brief stay at <a href="https://tthuruthel.com/"  target="_blank">Thomas George Thuruthel</a>'s lab, I developed techniques to optimize design of soft robots to 
      assist movement of the human joint. Then, we applied machine learning techniques to estimate contact forces between the soft robot and the human joint.

      I was part of two EU funded projects, <a href="https://project-sophia.eu/"  target="_blank">SOPHIA</a>, 
      and <a href="https://swag-project.eu/"  target="_blank">SWAG</a> with 
      and <a href="https://people.utwente.nl/m.sartori/"  target="_blank">Prof. Massimo Sartori</a>. <br>
      <b>SOPHIA</b>: Our partners were really interested in improving conditions for factory workers. To this end, I developed fatigue models to monitor musculoskeletal loading 
      after repeated lifting of heavy weights. 
      I also guided projects were we benchmarked different exoskeletons for an industrial workplace. We also tested neural interfaces that were used to control assistive robots 
      for the lower back and showed their benefits in reducing musculoskeletal loads. <br>
      <b>SWAG</b>: The project kicked off only recently (2023). We aim to improve wearability of our neural interface models so it can be deployed easily in daily life. 
      We will also test our interface models with novel high-strength and lightweight exosuits developed by partners. I will update you if we have interesting results.

      title="Doctoral Candidate, University of Twente"

      During my PhD, I focused mainly on reducing sensors needed to measure movement quality post stroke. The project was funded by the Dutch Science Foundation.
      I was supervised by dr. Bert-Jan F. van Beijnum, prof. Jaap H. Buurke, and prof. Peter H. Veltink.
      During my time here, I identified metrics that reflect movement quality post stroke by performing systematic reviews. 
      Simultaneously, I developed a Portable Gait Lab system consisting of three inertial measurement units powered by the magic of sensor fusion and biomechanical principles of gait.
      This technology was patented too!

      The master thesis was eventually a part of my PhD and also resulted in a publication. I evaluated and showed the feasibility of using pressure insoles as a lightweight and inconspicuous alternative for the bulky force sensors present in the ForceShoesᵀᴹ for estimating gait stability measures.

      This short internship was part of my MSc degree. I collected data from healthy volunteers and analyzed changes in EMG power spectrum during static and walking conditions. We found that the power spectrum of the EMG shifted in different directions among different participants.

      As I was new to the Netherlands, I wanted to explore the research network. So, I spent my first summer helping researchers at RRD with the EVOLUTIONS project. I edited an in house MATLABᵀᴹ based gait analysis tool by improving their UI and functionality based on the requirements and feedback from the researchers.

      After my Ph.D., I spent a few months teaching 'De Bewegende Mens en Gezondheidsrecht ' course (202000825) for Bachelor Technical Medicine students. I was the instructor for the Motion Capture practical, and setup  different laboratory equipment and and drafted course-specific manuals for them. The equipment included Qualisys motion tracker, Force plates, Delsys EMG systems, and Biodex dynamometer. I evaluated their experimental protocols and final course reports as part of the course requirements.

      During my stint here, I serviced, installed, demonstrated use of, and maintained biomedical equipment in several hospitals and clinics across South India and New Delhi. The equipment included ventilators, infusion pumps, baby warmers, and patient monitors. I enjoyed problem solving and troubleshooting faulty medical equipment and understanding the pain points of the healthcare workers using them.

      My first real job was working at one of India's largest software consulting firms. I worked with C# and VB .NET. I built desktop and website applications for an American company: Traveler's Insurance. The company had recently added 401(k) pension plans, and we had to enable its functionality on their desktop and website apps.
