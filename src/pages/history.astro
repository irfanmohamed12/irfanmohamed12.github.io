        Although I was born in Tamil Nadu, India, I was raised in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 
        I studied in the same school where my parents taught Mathematics. So, we went together 
        almost everywhere. Our school was run by the large Indian community in Saudi Arabia, so 
        I grew up in an Indian bubble far from home. <br> 
        <br>        
        I moved back to India to continue with my high school and bachelor's in Biomedical Engineering. This was not a
        very common choice for a bachelor's back then! <br>         
        <br> 
        After university, I worked at a software firm, but I wanted to move closer 
        to Biomedical Engineering, and joined a small company that serviced medical equipment for government-funded clinics 
        and hospitals. <br>
        <br> 
        Very shortly after, I moved to the Netherlands for my masters, and I have stayed here since. <br>        
        <br> 
        My brother is a cardiovascular surgeon back home, and my sister is defining herself as an architect.<br>
        <br> 
        Back in high school, I met Ashwini US, and years later am happily married to her. We are learning the ropes of 
        parenting from our 2 year old son.
