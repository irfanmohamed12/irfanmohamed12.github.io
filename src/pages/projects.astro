    img="/learning_interactions.webp"
    desc="The primary objective of this PhD to develop and validate novel models of the human-exosuit interfaces during movement. Key tasks may include developing fundamental interaction models using the SoRoSim toolbox (MATLAB) which offers a general framework for modelling soft and rigid robots. This will be followed with applications in dynamic scenarios using physics simulators such as MyoSuite (python). Finally, these models would be validated on data collected from phantom limbs or experimental studies from rehabilitation, occupational, or space use."

    desc="The multidisciplinary initiative in the field of soft robotics focuses on the development of soft wearable exoskeletal robots to empower the lower body and core. The project aims to replace traditional rigid materials found in exoskeletons, with high-strength, inflatable fabrics and sensing films to create smart, human-assistive, soft and lightweight garments. The envisioned exosuits will ensure user comfort and safety, while remaining virtually undetected, invisible under clothing due to their garment-like design."
