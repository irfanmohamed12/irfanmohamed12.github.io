    desc="The multidisciplinary initiative in the field of soft robotics focuses on the development of soft wearable exoskeletal robots to empower the lower body and core. The project aims to replace traditional rigid materials found in exoskeletons, with high-strength, inflatable fabrics and sensing films to create smart, human-assistive, soft and lightweight garments. The envisioned exosuits will ensure user comfort and safety, while remaining virtually undetected, invisible under clothing due to their garment-like design."
