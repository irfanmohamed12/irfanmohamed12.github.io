    desc="Wearable movement sensors collect a plethora of data from users using different modalities to develop digital twins. The models required to personalize these digital twins are computationally heavy. Federated learning can be a potential solution in reducing their complexity for edge devices. Your mission is to develop techniques that optimizes deployment of large-scale continual models on edge devices."
