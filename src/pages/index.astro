        In the not-so-distant future, we will merge ourselves with machines 🦾 that enhance our abilities. <br> <br>  
        As <b>Homohybrids</b>, we will overcome existing motor deficits or even perform superhuman tasks. This vision inspires me to <br>
        <em>bridge the man-machine gap by developing wearable and accessible assistive technologies</em>. <br>        
        As a start, I focus on solutions for assisting occupational tasks and hope to extend these ideas for space exploration. <br>

        By day, I am an Assistant Professor at the Neuromuscular Robotics Chair at the University of Twente. Outside of work, my partner and I
        are navigating the joys (and challenges) of parenting. Watching our son figure out his environment is pretty much akin to a novice AI 
        that improves with new data.         
        <br>
        And when I can, I play Basketball 🏀.
