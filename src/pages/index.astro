        Actually, Mohamed Irfan Refai, and Irfan in short 🙂 <br>
        <br>
        Not very far in the future, we will merge ourselves with machines that enhance our abilities. <br> 
        As <i>Homohybrids</i>, we will tackle any motor deficits or perform superhuman tasks. This vision drives me to <br>
        <em>reduce the man-machine barrier by developing wearable and accessible assistive technology</em>. <br>        
        To get there, I focus on applications for assisting during occupational tasks and hope to translate ideas for space exploration. <br>
        <br>        
        During working hours, I am an Assistant Professor at the Neuromuscular Robotics Chair at the University of Twente. At all other times, I am learning 
        how to parent my son. Watching my son figure out his environment is pretty much akin to a naive AI that gets better with new data. 
        Research and Parenting are both very rewarding! <br>
        <br>
        And during whatever time is left, I play Basketball 🏀.
